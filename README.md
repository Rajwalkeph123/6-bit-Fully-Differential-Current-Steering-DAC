6-bit-Fully-Differential-Current-Steering-DAC
This project presents the design and implementation of a high-performance 6-bit
 fully differential current-steering Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) using a 180
 nm CMOS process. The DAC is optimized for low-power and high-precision
 applications, operating with an analog supply voltage of 1.8 V and delivering a
 full-scale output voltage of 1.6 V peak-to-peak within an analog input range of 0
 V to 1.6 V. The architecture ensures superior linearity, achieving a maximum
 Integral Non-Linearity (INL) and Differential Non-Linearity (DNL) of Â±0.5 LSB,
 meeting stringent precision requirements.
 To enhance signal integrity, a fully differential design is employed, effectively
 mitigating common-mode noise and improving resilience to interference. The
 circuit integrates advanced techniques such as binary-weighted current sources
 and cascode current mirrors, ensuring high dynamic range and stability. Despite
 its robust performance, the DAC achieves remarkable energy efficiency, with a
 maximum static power consumption of less than 1 mW
